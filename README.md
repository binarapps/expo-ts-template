# @binarapps/expo-ts-template

This is a template to be used with react native and expo. It includes all the necessary stuff to start working with expo framework. It has the most popular packages included, so it's easier to start coding the app itself without all the necessary boilerplate setup.

## Why to use?

We know there are a lot of project starters for react native, but we have some good features:

- Fully works with **EXPO GO**
  - Good for start the project and later you can switch to expo-dev-client
- Fully works on **WEB**
  - If you want to develop apps both on web and mobile this starter is good choice for you
- **Code generators** (create new screen / create new component)
- **Fully + Strong typed**
- **App deployment documentation** (currently in progress, but it will be added in near future)

## How it looks?

Check this recording of how it look like:

[![expo-ts-template binarapps](https://img.youtube.com/vi/NmTd5nXXTLI/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NmTd5nXXTLI)

## How to use?

We have prepared a detailed documentation for how to run project with this template - **[Bootstrap docs](./documentation/docs/BOOTSTRAP.md)**

It's great for production project, but if you want to just test it, you can follow the quick steps (on the bottom).

### Quick steps:

- `npx create-expo-app --template=@binarapps/expo-ts-template name_of_your_app`
- `cd name_of_your_app`
- `yarn bootstrap` - the cli will ask you some questinos about your app (you can fill all this data later)

## Icons

This template uses [Remix icon set](https://remixicon.com/)

It is added to the app as a font generated by [icomoon app](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select).

### Adding new icons

1. Find `assets/icomoon/selection.json` file in your machine
2. Import this file to this [page (icomoon app)](https://icomoon.io/app/#/select):

- Make sure there are no other icons imported there

3. Download icon which need to be added to the app as svg file.
4. Make sure new icon name is unique (already not used).
5. Add svg file to icomoon app.
6. Go to generate font tab - icomoon app.

- Make sure that all icons that you have added have correct names

7. Download font - icomoon app
8. Replace old files with downloaded ones

- ./selection.json => assets/icomoon/selection.json
- ./fonts/icomoon.ttf => assets/icomoon/icomoon.ttf

9. Generate new types for icons

- run script generating icon types `yarn generate:icon:types`

## Adding jotai as state management tool

This starter doesn't go with any state management tool, but we have created separate branch with jotai setup, maybe in the future we will add more tools support.

To use jotai with this starter you can check bootstrap docs: **[Bootstrap docs](./documentation/docs/BOOTSTRAP.md#jotai)**
